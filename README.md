# CryptoClustering
Module_19_Challenge
I renamed the Crypto_Clustering_starter_code.ipynb file as Crypto_Clustering.ipynb. I loaded the Crypto_market_data.csv into a dataframe. I got the summary statistics and plotted the data. I used the Standard scalar module() from scikit learn. I created a dataframe with the scale data and set the coin_id index from the Original dataframe as the index for the new dataframe. I found the best value for k using the original scale dataframe. I worked with the cluster cryptocurrencies with K-means using the original scale data. I optimized the clusters with principal component analysis. I found the best value for k using the PCA data. I used the Cluster cryptocurrencies with k-means using the PCA data. I made composing plots using the Composing plots using the hvPlot documentation.
